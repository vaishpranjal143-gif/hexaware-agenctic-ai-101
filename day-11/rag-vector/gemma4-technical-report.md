Gemma 4 Technical Report
Gemma Team, Google DeepMind1
We introduce Gemma 4, a new generation of open-weight, natively multimodal language models in the
Gemma model family. Designed to advance compute efficiency and reasoning, the Gemma 4 model suite
features dense and Mixture-of-Experts architectures, ranging from 2.3B to 31B parameters. Alongside
improved vision and audio encoders for all model sizes, we propose a unified, encoder-free architecture
for our 12B model, which ingests raw audio and image patches. Furthermore, we integrate a thinking
mode, enabling Gemma models to generate reasoning traces prior to responding. We improve inference
speed, memory, and compute efficiency, as well as long-context abilities through critical design choices.
Gemma 4 establishes a leap in performance across STEM, multimodal, and long-context benchmarks,
and rivals larger, frontier open models in human-rated tasks.
1. Introduction
The rapid evolution of large language models
has driven the need for open-weight models with
strongmultimodalunderstanding, reasoning, and
computational efficiency. Building upon the
foundations of its predecessors (Gemma Team,
2024a,b, 2025a), we introduce Gemma 4, the
most capable and efficient generation in the
Gemma model family to date. Gemma 4 offers na-
tively multimodal architectures, capable of seam-
lessly processing text, images, and audio while
achieving frontier-level performance on highly
complex reasoning tasks. The Gemma 4 fam-
ily is built to serve a variety of on-device hard-
ware. The model suite includes both dense archi-
tectures (2.3B, 4.5B, 12B, and 31B parameters)
and a Mixture-of-Experts (Jacobs et al., 1991,
MoE) variant with 3.8B activated and 26B total
parameters. We introduce several architectural
and methodological innovations:
• Thinking mode for advanced reasoning:We
introduce a thinking mode (OpenAI, 2024) to
Gemma 4 models. By outputting a reasoning
trace before the response, models demonstrate
improved capabilities in reasoning-heavy do-
mains such as mathematics and coding.
• Long-context efficiency:Extended contexts
lead to a memory explosion in the KV cache.
We conserve a 5:1 ratio of local sliding window
to global self-attention (4:1 for the 2.3B model)
and use𝑝-RoPE (Barbero et al., 2025) as po-
sitional encoding. Combined with KV cache
sharing (Shazeer, 2019) and the reuse of keys
as values in global layers (Kayyam et al., 2026),
these optimizations reduce the global KV cache
footprint by up to 37.5%.
• Compute efficiency:We release an autore-
gressive multi-token prediction (MTP) drafter
head (Li et al., 2024) designed for speculative
decoding (Leviathan et al., 2023) to improve
the decoding speed of our models.
• Memory efficiency:We provide quantized ver-
sions of our models trained with quantization-
aware training (Jacob et al., 2018, QAT) to
reduce their parameter memory footprint and
latency with minimal impact on quality.
• Encoder-free architecture: Gemma 4 models
have frozen vision and audio encoders. We in-
troduce a unified encoder-free architecture for
the 12B model, which projects raw 40ms audio
chunks and image patches into the LLM embed-
ding space, alleviating the need for separate
encoders and reducing memory fragmentation.
In this technical report, we outline the different
model architectures across model sizes as well
as the pre-training and post-training recipe of
Gemma 4. Through comprehensive benchmarks
and human evaluations such as Arena (Chiang
et al., 2024), we demonstrate that Gemma 4 op-
erates at a level comparable to larger, frontier
open-source models across text, image, and au-
dio modalities. We release the Gemma 4 models
under an Apache 2.0 license, empowering devel-
opers and researchers everywhere to build upon,
customize, and extend these capabilities.

model noted with a star is an MoE defined by its number of active parameters. Note that the extra
embedder parameters in E2B and E4B are per-layer embeddings.
2. Model Architecture
Gemma 4 models follow a decoder-only Trans-
former architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017).
Our models have pre-norm and post-norm
with RMSNorm (Zhang and Sennrich, 2019),
and QKNorm (Henry et al., 2020).
Dense and MoE:The Gemma 4 family of
models comprises dense architectures, with ef-
fective 2.3B (E2B), effective 4.5B (E4B),12B
and31Bparameters, as well as an MoE model
with 3.8B activated parameters for 26B total pa-
rameters (26B-A4B). E2B and E4B use per-layer
embeddings as in Gemma 3n (Gemma Team,
2025b), making them 2.3B and 4.5B effective
out of 5B and 8B total parameters respectively.

Long-context efficiency:Our local to global
attention ratio patterns follow Gemma Team
(2025a), that is, 4-to-1 local attention blocks
for E2B and 5-to-1 for the rest. We improve
memory efficiency by re-using keys as values
in the global attention layers (except in E2B
andE4B),i.e. , values=keys . Weencodeposition
with 𝑝-RoPE with𝑝= 0.25on global attention
layers and with RoPE on local attention layers, ef-
fectively reducing the global KV cache by 37.5%.
The RoPE frequencies are set to 1M and 10k on
global and local attention layers, respectively. Fi-
nally, we share the KV cache with ratios of 20/35
and 18/42 for the E2B and E4B model.
2.1. Vision modality
E2B and E4B Gemma models come with a 150M
vision encoder, while larger models use a 550M
encoder (except for the unified 12B). Both are Vi-
sion Transformers (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021, ViT)
with a patch size of 16, whose architectural differ-
ences are detailed in Table 10 in Appendix. Our
visionencoderssupportvariableaspectratios(see
Figure 2 and Algorithm 1) and incorporate both
axial 2D-RoPE (Heo et al., 2024) with non-causal
attention and 2D absolute positional embeddings.
We restrict the maximum number of tokens,𝑁max
to the values70, 140, 280, 560and1120(see Al-
gorithm 1 for implementation details).
2.2. Audio modality
E2B and E4B Gemma models use a 305M au-
dio encoder that processes audio in 40ms chunks
with Mel filterbank inputs. The encoder ar-
chitecture is based on the Universal Speech
Model (Zhang et al., 2023, USM), consisting of
two downsampling convolution layers followed
by twelve Conformer layers (Gulati et al., 2020).
While the architecture remains similar to that of
Gemma 3n, we reduce the number of parame-
ters by 55% (from 680M to 305M). We do not
use vector quantization; the LLM ingests the con-
2

Gemma 4 Technical Report
tinuous representations produced by the audio
encoder. As with the vision encoder, we keep
weights frozen during pre-training.
2.3. Encoder-free architecture
Gemma 4 12B is trained from scratch based
on a new, unified, and encoder-free model
paradigm, replacing the separate vision and au-
dio encoders with lightweight projection mod-
ules. For the vision modality, Gemma 4 12B takes
in 48×48×3 RGB patches, but replaces the 550M
vision encoder by a single large matmul (35M
parameters). Spatial awareness is maintained by
adding 2D coordinate-based positional embed-
dings directly to the patch representations before
a final LayerNorm layer (Ba et al., 2016).
For audio, the 305M USM-based conformer en-
coder isentirely discarded. Raw audio is seg-
mented into 40ms chunks at 16kHz, resulting
in 640-dimensional vectors per chunk. These are
projected directly into the LLM embedding space.
Since audio is a temporal sequence, it does not
require additional positional encoding.

We follow a similar pre-training as Gemma 3.

scale, diverse collection of data from a wide range
of domains and modalities, including web doc-
uments, code, images, and audio (for E2B, E4B
and 12B), with a cutoff date of January 2025.

ini Team (2025) that is, a SentencePiece tok-

enizer (Kudo and Richardson, 2018) with split
digits, preserved whitespace, and byte-level en-
codings. The vocabulary has 262k entries.
Filtering.We filter data to decontaminate bench-
marks, and to reduce the risk of unwanted or
unsafe utterances and the risk of recitation.
2.5. Quantization-Aware Training
We provide quantized models and encoders in
different formats along with the raw checkpoints.
Based on the most popular open source quantiza-
tion inference engines (e.g.llama.cpp) as well
as efficient hardware support, we focus on two
sets of weight representations:
• mobile quantization: per-channel low bitwidth
weight (mix of int2 and int4) and activation
quantization (int8).
• Q4_0 quantization: blockwise quantization, of-
ten referred to as Q4_0.
In Table 3, we report the memory filled by raw
and quantized models with and without a KV
cache for a sequence of 32k tokens. Furthermore,
to enable stable inference in fp16, we introduce
a scalar scale at each block in order to bound the
activation ranges to fit fp16.

Table 4| Leading open-weight models on Arena Text (Chiang et al., 2024) (as of June 19, 2026).
Models are evaluated through blind side-by-side evaluations by human raters, and attributed scores
based on the Elo rating system. The top closed model (gray) is included for scale. Gemma models
rival much larger models, and Gemma 4 31B is the leading dense open model on the leaderboard.
We also apply QAT to the image and audio en-
coders. On the 150M image encoder, quantizing
activations and weights to 8-bit precision (W8A8)
yields a 2× reduction in total forward-pass mem-
ory footprint (from 400 MB to 200 MB, including
on-device compilation overhead) and a 44% re-
ductioninon-devicelatencyrelativetoGemma3n
on newer hardware. On the audio encoder, we
further reduce activation precision to 8 bits and
weight precision to{2, 4, 8} bits, varying by layer
cluster. Overall, we achieve a 78% reduction in
on-disk footprint, from 390MB in Gemma 3n
to 87MB in this version.
2.6. Multi-Token Prediction Drafter
We train a small autoregressive MTP drafter head
with our models, used for speculative decoding.
In our MTP procedure, the model’s last layer ac-
tivations from the previous step and token em-
beddings are fed into the MTP head. The MTP
head generates future tokens sequentially using
a separate embedder and a 4-layer Transformer
block that cross-attends to the KVs of the main
model (Figure 1), thus eliminating the need for
MTP prefill and supporting any draft length. The
Transformer block has model dimension 256 for
E2B and E4B, 1024 for 26B-A4B and 31B, three
local, and one global attention layers.
Efficient MTP Decoding.For the E2B and E4B
drafters, we reduce the decoding overhead by
replacing the projection operation to the entire
vocabulary by a top-k operation on clusters of
tokens. As a result, final matrix multiplication
is reduced from𝑑× 262, 000to 𝑑× 4096while
preserving a similar acceptance rate.
2.7. Compute Infrastructure
We train our models with TPUv5p and TPUv6e
as outlined in Table 2. Each model configuration
is optimized to minimize training step time. For
our larger models, we leverage Slice-Granularity
Elasticity(GeminiTeam,2025),whichallowscon-
tinuous training with fewer “slices” of TPU chips
when there is a localized failure. This reconfigu-
ration reduces the delay caused by interruptions
from many minutes to a few seconds.

Table 5| Performance comparison of Gemma 3 27B and Gemma 4 models on diverse benchmarks. All
models are in thinking mode unless explicitly stated.
The optimizer state is sharded using an im-
plementation of ZeRO-3 (Ren et al., 2021). For
multi-pod training, we perform a data replica re-
duction over the data center network, using the
Pathways approach of Barham et al. (2022). We
use the single controller programming paradigm
of JAX (Roberts et al., 2023) and Pathways, along
with the GSPMD partitioner (Xu et al., 2021) and
the MegaScale XLA compiler (XLA, 2019).
3. Instruction Tuning
Pre-trained models are turned into instruction-
tuned models with a similar post-training ap-
proach as in Gemma 3. A significant difference is
the addition of a thinking mode, where the model
can output a reasoning trace before answering.
Data filtering.We carefully optimize the data
used in post-training to maximize model perfor-
mance. We filter examples that show certain per-
sonal information, unsafe or toxic model outputs,
mistaken self-identification data, and duplicated
examples. Including subsets of data that encour-
age better in-context attribution, hedging, and
refusals to minimize hallucinations also improves
performance on factuality metrics, without de-
grading model performance on other metrics.
PT versus IT formatting.All models share the
same tokenizer, with some control tokens dedi-
cated to IT formatting. A key difference is that PT
models output an<eos> token at the end of gen-
eration, while IT models output<turn|> at the
end of the generation. An example is given for IT
in Table 11. Fine-tuning either model type thus
requires adding their respective end tokens. We
detail how to activate thinking and how models
handle function calling in Table 11.

use the maximal supported resolution (1120 vision tokens) and report results with 280 vision tokens
in Table 12. Gemma 3 27B is non-thinking and uses Pan & Scan.
4. Evaluation of final models
In this section, we evaluate the IT models over
a series of automated benchmarks and human
evaluations across a variety of domains, as well
as static benchmarks such as MMLU Pro.
4.1. Human evaluation
We report the performance of our 31B and 26B-
A4B models on Arena (Chiang et al., 2024) in
blind side-by-side evaluations by human raters
against other state-of-the-art models. We report
Elo scores in Table 4. Gemma 4 31B is the
top open model in the dense category, and both
Gemma 4 31B and 26B-A4B show performance
equal to much larger open models.
4.2. Static benchmarks
In Table 5, we show the performance of our fi-
nal models across a variety of benchmarks com-
pared to Gemma 3 27B. Gemma 4 31B is closest
in size and significantly better across the board,
while E2B roughly matches Gemma 3 27B perfor-
mance with 10x less parameters. Table 6 shows
the performance of Gemma 4 models on vision
benchmarks, with E4B equaling or outperform-
ing Gemma 3 27B on all evals. Tables 7 and 8
display the multilingual audio transcription and
translation performance of E2B & E4B and of 12B
respectively. Table 9 shows a leap on long-context
capabilities between Gemma 3 27B and Gemma 4
models, with E4B outperforming Gemma 3 27B.
5. Responsibility, Safety, Security
As open models become central to enterprise
infrastructure, provenance and security are
paramount. Gemma 4 undergoes the same rig-
orous safety evaluations as Gemini models. Re-
sponsibility, safety, and security are of utmost
importance in the development workflow, ensur-
ing that these language models are designed from
the ground up for responsible AI development.
5.1. Governance & Assessment
Our approach to assessing the benefits and risks
of Gemma 4 reflects the foundation established
in prior models, updated to account for its ex-
panded multimodal capabilities. We maintain the
belief that openness in AI can spread the bene-
fits of these technologies across society, but this
must be continuously evaluated against the risk
of malicious uses that can cause individual and
institutional harm (Weidinger et al., 2021).
Gemma 4 models were developed in partner-
shipwithinternalsafetyandresponsibleAIteams.
Releasing these models required careful scrutiny
of the evolving risks associated with LLMs and
an understanding of how models are deployed in
the wild. While an open model shares innovation
across the AI ecosystem, we remain committed
to providing educational resources to users and
monitoring downstream model usage.

5.2. Safety Policies and Train-Time Mitiga-
tions
A key pillar of Gemma’s safety approach is align-
ing our fine-tuned models with Google’s AI prin-
ciples and safety policies. These policies aim to
prevent our generative models from producing
harmful content, specifically:
• Content related to child sexual abuse material
(CSAM) and exploitation;
• Dangerous content, e.g., promoting suicide, or
instructing in activities that could cause real-
world harm;
•Sexually explicit content;
• Hate speech, e.g., dehumanizing members of
protected groups;
• Harassment, e.g., encouraging violence against
people.
To mitigate these risks, Gemma 4 models un-
derwent careful input data pre-processing and
scrutiny. The training data was specifically fil-
tered for the removal of certain personal infor-
mation and other sensitive data to guard against
privacy violations. Post-training evaluations and
train-time mitigations were also implemented to
align the model with our safety policies.
5.3. Safety Evaluations
We conduct rigorous automated and human eval-
uations to understand the potential harms our
modelsmightcause. Forallareasofsafetytesting,
we saw major improvements in every category of
content safety relative to previous Gemma mod-
els. Overall, Gemma 4 models significantly out-

perform Gemma 3 and 3n models in improving
safety, while keeping unjustified refusals low.
Importantly, all testing was conducted without
safety filters to accurately evaluate the model’s
inherent capabilities and behaviors. For both text-
to-text and image-to-text modalities, and across
all model sizes, the models produced minimal
policy violations. We balance development speed
with targeted safety testing, upholding the com-
mitments laid out in our Frontier Safety Frame-
work (Google DeepMind, 2024).
5.4. Ethical Considerations and Risk Mitiga-
tion
The development of LLMs introduces specific eth-
ical considerations. In making Gemma 4, we fo-
cused heavily on:
• Bias and Fairness: LLMs trained on large-scale
textandimagedatacanreflectembeddedsocio-
cultural biases. We encourage developers to
perform continuous monitoring (using evalua-
tionmetricsandhumanreview)andexplorede-
biasing techniques during model fine-tuning.
• Misinformation and Misuse: LLMs can be mis-
used to generate false or misleading text. We
provide technical limitations, developer educa-
tion, and guidelines for responsible use within
the Responsible Generative AI Toolkit to miti-
gate malicious applications.
• Privacy Considerations: While our training
datasets were filtered to remove certain per-
sonal information and other sensitive data, de-
velopers are strongly encouraged to adhere
to local privacy regulations and implement
privacy-preserving techniques in their applica-
tions.
5.5. Our Approach to Responsible Open Mod-
els
Designing safe, secure, and responsible applica-
tions requires a system-level approach that miti-
gates risks associated with specific use cases and
environments. We provide guidelines, mecha-
nisms, and safeguards for content safety, and
encourage developers to implement appropriate
configurationsbasedontheirproductpolicies. We
will continue to adopt safety mitigations propor-
tionate to potential risks, sharing these models
with the community only when confident that the
benefits significantly outweigh foreseeable risks.
6. Discussion and Conclusion
In this technical report, we presented Gemma
4, an open-weight model family featuring mul-
timodal dense and MoE architectures designed
for varied hardware environments. Gemma 4
models come with a thinking mode in which they
generate reasoning traces prior to responding,
improving overall performance. We introduced a
unified, encoder-free architecture that processes

raw audio and image patches. We also allevi-
ated long-context memory limitations via better
local-to-global attention ratios, positional encod-
ing, and KV cache sharing. We increased the
overall compute efficiency via QAT and memory
efficiency via MTP drafters. Gemma 4 models
demonstrate a leap in performance compared to
Gemma 3 across benchmarks, and human evalu-
ations demonstrate that Gemma 4 performs com-
parably to significantly larger open models, pro-
viding a scalable foundation for edge deployment
and reasoning while supporting open research.
